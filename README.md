Please checkout the [setup guide on the wiki](https://github.com/jketterl/openwebrx/wiki/Setup-Guide) for more details
on the respective methods.

## Community

If you have trouble setting up or configuring your receiver, you have some great idea you want to see implemented, or
you just generally want to have some OpenWebRX-related chat, come visit us over on
[our groups.io group](https://groups.io/g/openwebrx).

If you want to hang out, chat, or get in touch directly with the developers, receiver operators or users, feel free to
drop by in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/gnE9hPz).

## Usage tips

You can zoom the waterfall display by the mouse wheel. You can also drag the waterfall to pan across it.

The filter envelope can be dragged at its ends and moved around to set the passband.

However, if you hold down the shift key, you can drag the center line (BFO) or the whole passband (PBS).
